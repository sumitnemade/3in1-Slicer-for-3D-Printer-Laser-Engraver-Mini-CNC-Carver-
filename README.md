3D Printer+Laser Engraver+CNC Carver 3 in 1 machine with android app control.This 3D printer which is easy-to-use for beginners, expandable for makers, and truly affordable for everyone.
<br>
Thatâ€™s why we designed Expander LV5 to all-in-one.
<br>
It's also a desktop makerspace, a combination of 3D printer, laser engraver, and CNC machine with interchangeable heads. We can't wait to share it with the patreon community and have you help nurture this unique machine with us.
<br>
Expander LV5 can be easily transformed into a laser engraver using the add-on 5500mW laser module. You can laser engrave images and logos on wood, bamboo, leather, plastic, fabric, paper and other soft surfaces. Now, customize your wallets, coasters, leather iPad cases, jeans, and more!
<br>
You can do CNC carving on wood, PCB and acrylic using the add-on CNC module. The interchangeable modules equip you with more creative power from 3D printing to 3D carving. Instead of purchasing three machines, now you can use one compact and reliable machine, saving your money and desktop space.
<br>
We not only love 3D printing, but also have a great interest in a number of creative designs. In fact, there are lots of like-minded people who want to create more than 3D printing. We found that all 3D printer, laser engraver and cnc carving machine require a three-axis linear motion system to work. So we combined them into one machine that performs all functions.
